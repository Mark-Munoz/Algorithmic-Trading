Primary Objective: Develop a comprehensive investment analysis tool focused on the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). This tool will perform a detailed risk analysis of the ETF, construct an efficient frontier based on its constituents, and apply price momentum factor analysis for portfolio optimization.

Integrated Steps:
    Risk Analysis of S&P 500 ETF Constituents (adapted from Project #1)
        Select a basket of assets from the S&P 500 ETF.
        Perform a detailed risk analysis of these selected constituents against major indices (SPY, IWM, DIA).
        Create tables showing the risk analysis of each constituent, including metrics like volatility, beta, drawdowns, total return, etc.

  Efficient Frontier of S&P 500 Constituents (adapted from Project #2)
        Utilize the same selected assets from the S&P 500 ETF.
        Compute individual risk/return profiles for these constituents.
        Calculate the mean, variance, and correlation matrix for these assets.
        Apply a Monte-Carlo method to determine the efficient frontier and optimal weights.
        Visualize the results using graphing tools, focusing on the efficient frontier and correlation matrix.
        Identify the optimal portfolio weighting for the maximum Sharpe Ratio within the S&P 500 constituents.

  Price Momentum Factor Analysis and Backtesting (from Project #3)
        Choose a set of assets from within the S&P 500 ETF for analysis.
        Calculate the price momentum factors for each selected asset.
        Identify long and short baskets based on momentum factors.
        Conduct a 5-year backtest to evaluate the performance of the selected strategy.
        Chart the monthly and cumulative portfolio returns, comparing the performance of long versus short picks against the overall S&P 500 ETF.

# Algorithmic-Trading

Final Project Assignment

Primary Objective: Use Berry Cox’s price momentum factors to select basket of assets for a long-short
portfolio. Backtest your algorithm for 5 years to check for performance of algorithm.
Background: The use of computers and coding allows finance professionals to identify new alpha factors –
Alpha factors are ways of quantifying where alpha is being generated by an asset. You will be responsible
for using Berry Cox’s list of alpha factors to determine the long/short baskets for your portfolio. But in
order to test your code and its asset selections, back-testing must be performed.

The Requirements:
Step 1: Choose an ETF with a minimum of 100 assets, identify those assets
Step 2: Retrieve historical data for your chosen ETF
Step 3: Calculate the price momentum factors for each asset in your ETF
Step 4: Using the price momentum factors, calculate the monthly z-factor score for each asset
Step 5: Identify long and short baskets (10 to 15 assets in each) using calculated z-factors
Step 6: Create a backtest to validate performance of your algorithm based on monthly restructuring over the
previous 5 years.
Step 7: Chart:
1. Monthly portfolio return bar chart (pos/neg coloring) vs ETF
2. Monthly return for long picks vs short picks vs ETF
3. Cumulative portfolio return vs ETF
